# TOEFL作文经验谈

#### Common Writing Questions:
* People care more about public recognition than about money. Even if no more money is given, public recognition can still make people work harder. 
* Some people say that students should study many lessons during a semester, but others say that it is better for students to just take three or four lessons. Which do you think is better? 
* Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way to truly relax and reduce stress is to spend time alone. 
* Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The food we eat today is much healthier than in the past.  
        
        可见题型基本上不是A or B is better就是Do you agree...
	
#### 文章架构：辩证思维！

        最好不要little bit of both. 还是需要take side的。但是凡事都不是绝对的，所以要具体地、辩证地看待问题。再具体一点：用让步的写法！
	
#### 所谓“-++”的结构。
* A or B is better：
	    
        第一段：背景+主题句（第一段结尾），比如A is better。
        第二段: 诚然, B的确有优点...但是B有缺点...相比之下A更好。
        第三段：A的优点1
        第四段：A的优点2， 或者：如果没有A，会有什么后果
        第五段：结尾（可以提出相关做法）
当然也可以采用++-的结构。比如写完A的优点，用一个短篇幅的段落写一下B也不是一无是处。同理，
* Do you agree...：

        第一段：背景+主题句（第一段结尾），比如（I believe）观点A（意思是由背景直接过渡到观点，可以不需要I believe之类的引导词）
        第二段: 也许有人会认为-A（A的反面）。但是他们的观点有什么缺陷...有更多的理由让我相信A
        第三段：A的理由1
        第四段：A的理由2
        第五段：结尾（可以提出相关做法）

#### 一篇例文
> Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way to truly relax and reduce stress is to spend time alone. 

21-centry man is under a lot of pressure. In an increasingly connected global economy, people are constantly stressed to be competing with others in jobs, education or even in lives, which potentially undermines people's well-being and the quality of life. It may seems contrary to the intuition of many but oftentimes to disconnect — to spend some time along may be the best way to truly relax and reduce stress.

Admittedly, there are many ways to spend one's leisure time with others in a relaxing way. For example, to go and watch a movie with a loved one; to play some sports with friends; to go on a vacation with family, just to name a few. But once the activities stops, stress will come back, sometimes in an even more intense fashion, let alone planning those activities may be stressful itself.

Spending time alone can give people inner peace, which ultimately releases the stress. Imagine it is bed time but you still have a lot on mind and you simply cannot get asleep. What should you do? Sleep experts may recommend an effective method: meditation. Simply close your eyes, have a deep breath and try to concentrate on your sense of feelings to clear up your mind. In fact, meditation has been proven to be beneficial not only for sleep but generally for having better well-being. The outside world is constantly consuming our energy so the only way to be truly relaxed is to detach ourselves from the outside though meditation: What do we want? What do we value? What is the purpose of our lives? Too often people rush through their daily routines and fail to realize their life is out of order and direction. It's crucial for us to stop for a while and spend some time alone, looking into our inner selves and reorganize their lives.

Moreover, many of our stresses nowadays are rooted in the fact we are continuously wired to the internet and to other people thanks to technologies like computers and mobile devices. In my experiences, online shopping appears to be a very time-consuming thus very stressful experience because I am offered so many choices that I don't know what to choose. Besides, I have read news report about teenagers madly checks their mobile phones at short intervals to see whether others have commented on their posts or in fear of missing out any group event. In cases like these, just as to cure a disease requires curing its root, to be truly stress-free is to be disconnected and spend time alone.

Stress is a prevalent problem in modern society. Spending time alone is our best weapon but what to do during that time may vary person to person. Only by knowing the roots of our stress and getting better understanding of ourselves can we be truly relaxed, which, inevitably, requires spending some time alone to look inside our inner world.


#### 让步语气的写法
` 前半句：`

* It is true / correct that ...
* No doubt, Undoubtedly
* do, may, seem, appear
* Admittedly
* concede, admit, acknowledge

` 后半句：`

* but, however, yet
	
#### 中间段落论述的一般结构，即如何展开一个分支观点
* 1.态度+理由
* 2.解释理由
* 3.定义例子
* 4.用验证验证理由
	
	##### 不是绝对的！有时一个例子能单独占一段。有时上来先假设一个场景。总之自圆其说即可，形式可以灵活多变。

#### 哪些可以作为例子充实你的论述？
* 假设并描述一个场景：Suppose you are ... 
* Data or survey: According to a survey... According to statistics... 
* 权威的理论
* 名人名言
* 亲身经历
* 打比方
* 新闻、故事……

        不关注例子和数据的真实性！避免用一些烂俗的例子。
        
#### 如果担心字数不够多怎么办？
        用一个字数比较多的模板！用一些复合句把每个段落的主题句写得长一些。比如：Firstly...可以换成The first point I want to make is ... 或者The first reason I believe XX is better than YY is ...
        当然最好把内容充实起来！可以多写几个例子！
        开头也可以略微发散一下，谈谈整个issue的背景。

#### 如果时间不够怎么办？
        如果考试到了最后五分钟，还没有写结尾，请打住。尽快把正在写的段落结束，留出时间把结尾好好写了。
        如果按照“-++”的结构写的话，至少要确保第一个+的段落充分论证了。第二个甚至第三个+的段落简略一点，无伤大雅。
        另外，有人可能会建议先把作文的整体框架搭好，也就是说先把开头、中间每个段落的第一句和结尾写好，再补充内容。我的看法是，除非你在拿到这个题目的时候很快就对全篇有了清晰的构思，否则就从头开始写。理由是不能再审题时花费太多的时间，一般5分钟后就必须开始打字了，这时有个模糊的框架的可以了，然后在写作的过程中，往往就会对后面的内容有了新的灵感。而结尾是对已经写的内容的一个总结和升华，很大程度是对主题句的重复以及针对主题提出一些建议，不是特别难写。合理地设定一个“止血点”写结尾就可以了。
